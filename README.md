# Personal Daily Planner

## A simple calendar application that allows a user save events for each hour of the work day

## Overview

Designed as a single-service page, the daily planner shows the user text blocks representing their normal working hours (9am to 5pm). The blocks are color coded to indicate whether they're in the past(grey), present(red) or future(green).

The use can type anything they wish into each block and click the save icon next to that block to make the text persist on the page. 

ðŸ˜ƒ Use this planner to write down notes for your upcoming day! Click [here](https://ugopreneur.github.io/personal-daily-planner/) to try it out.
